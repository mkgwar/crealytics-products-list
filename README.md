# Crealytics Product List

- A small web app which displays all the products matching the user search criteria.
- Typing in the search box will show products matching the criteria dynamically.
- 100 products will be displayed per page.
- Since the image links present in products.csv are not working, random images have been used instead.
- All additional images will be displayed in the bottom. Clicking on them will show the image on the main area.
- We can also filter the search result according to **Gender** and whether the products are **On Sale** or not.

## How to Run

1. `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
2. `npm run dev` to start the app.
3. `npm run test` to run test cases and get the code coverage.
